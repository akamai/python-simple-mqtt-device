# Overview 

This is where some sample MQTT Paho client (https://www.eclipse.org/paho/) programs (multiple but one project) show how to connect to IoT Edge Connect.

# Get started 

In order to start using `python-simple-mqtt-device` MQTT client, add `configuration.txt` file to `/resources` folder.
It should have the following syntax: 

```
mqtt.host = <your-domain-name>
topic.prefix = <topic-prefix>
client.id.prefix = <client-id-prefix>
```

**Note:** You should receive a configuration file from [IoTDevelopers@akamai.com](mailto:IoTDevelopers@akamai.com), after requesting a Sandbox.

# Publish and Subscribe

You need Python 3.6 or newer to run the examples. The recommended way to run this project is within a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There are two main files to run:
```bash
python -m subscriber
python -m publisher
```

Upon running, you will be prompted to provide `username` and `password` to your Sandbox. 
Look for the details in the email received from [IoTDevelopers@akamai.com](mailto:IoTDevelopers@akamai.com), after requesting a Sandbox.

Sample users received in an email:
```
Device users: user_1, user1_2, user1_3, user1_4
User's default password: secret
```

**Note:** Default password is the same for all the device users.
